# Technical Specification: Secure E-Commerce Operations and Inventory Management Platform

**Project Type:** Full-Stack E-Commerce Operations SaaS / Internal Administration Platform  
**Primary Focus:** Product Catalogs, Inventory Control, Order Management, Payment Reconciliation, Fulfillment Workflows, Staff Access Control, and Audit Trails  
**Target Users:** E-commerce operators, store owners, inventory managers, fulfillment teams, finance staff, and customer support teams  
**Engineering Objective:** Build a secure, traceable operational core that centralizes essential commerce workflows, preserves inventory accuracy, controls staff access, and provides a reliable record of every important business operation.

## 1. Objective

Develop a centralized e-commerce operations platform that enables a business to manage its product catalog, inventory, orders, payment states, fulfillment workflows, and staff permissions through a consistent interface and documented API.

The application should replace disconnected operational spreadsheets, inconsistent internal tools, and fragile custom integrations with a system that provides reliable data, controlled state transitions, and traceable changes.

The central engineering challenge is not simply implementing product and order CRUD operations. It is maintaining correct relationships between inventory, orders, payment records, fulfillment events, and staff actions when requests fail, operations are retried, or multiple people work simultaneously.

The finished application must allow authorized staff to:

1. Create and maintain products, SKUs, variants, pricing information, and catalog metadata.
2. Track stock levels and inventory movements across one or more locations.
3. Reserve available stock for eligible orders and release reservations when required.
4. Process orders through explicit, validated operational states.
5. Track payment attempts, confirmations, failures, refunds, and reconciliation discrepancies.
6. Manage picking, packing, shipping, cancellations, and fulfillment exceptions.
7. Assign staff roles and restrict access to sensitive operational functions.
8. Record important changes in an auditable history.
9. Search and filter products, inventory, orders, payments, and fulfillment records.
10. Integrate with payment providers and other external systems through clearly defined adapters.
11. Recover from duplicate requests, delayed webhooks, failed external calls, and concurrent inventory updates.
12. Expose reliable, documented APIs for the dashboard and future integrations.

**Core principle:** Every inventory movement must be explainable, every order and payment must have a well-defined lifecycle, every sensitive action must be authorized, and every important operational change must leave a traceable record.

## 2. Product Scope

Build an internal operations platform first. A complete public storefront, marketing website, recommendation engine, advanced pricing engine, and marketplace architecture are not required for the initial release.

### 2.1 Core modules

| Module | Main responsibility |
|---|---|
| Catalog | Manage products, variants, SKUs, and product status |
| Inventory | Track on-hand, reserved, and available stock |
| Orders | Manage order records, line items, and lifecycle transitions |
| Payments | Track payment attempts, provider events, and refunds |
| Fulfillment | Coordinate picking, packing, shipping, and dispatch |
| Staff and access | Authenticate staff and enforce role-based permissions |
| Audit history | Record important operational changes |
| Reporting | Provide operational summaries and exception visibility |
| Integrations | Connect external services through explicit provider adapters |

### 2.2 Initial assumptions

The implementation should use the following initial assumptions unless the existing product requirements specify otherwise:

- The application serves one or more merchant organizations.
- An organization may manage one or more stores.
- Products can have variants, with each sellable variant represented by a unique SKU within the applicable catalog scope.
- Inventory can be tracked by warehouse or stock location.
- Orders may originate from the application's internal workflow or an explicitly implemented integration.
- Payment processing is delegated to a supported payment provider.
- Staff access is restricted by organization, store, and operational role as applicable.
- Development environments may use clearly labeled test data and simulated provider responses.

Do not claim to support a specific commerce platform, payment gateway, shipping carrier, or accounting service until its adapter is actually implemented and verified.
